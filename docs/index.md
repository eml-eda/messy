The availability of simulation platforms is a key ingredient for making RISC-V based hardware solutions pervasive. Simulators represent a cost-effective and scalable solution that enable rapid prototyping without the need for physical hardware. For these reasons, there is a growing availability of programs designed to simulate entire RISC-V chips. Some options include QEMU, Simulink, Renode, and GVSoC. However, these tools present some limitations. Most of them only simulate the computing core with scarce possibilities to perform system-level simulations. Moreover, they simulate only functional features, with poor support for extra-functional properties such as power consumption. This work tries to address these challenges by presenting a flexible simulator.

MESSY is an open-source framework that integrates functional RISC-V simulation (achieved with GVSoC for the PULP cores) with SystemC-AMS (used to model extra-functional aspects, in detail power storage and distribution). The combination of GVSoC and SystemC-AMS in a single simulation framework allows to perform a DSE that is dependent on the mutual impact between functional and extra-functional aspects.
